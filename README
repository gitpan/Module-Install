This is the README file for Module::Install, a standalone, extensible
installer for Perl modules.  It is designed to be a drop-in replacement
for ExtUtils::MakeMaker, and is a descendent of CPAN::MakeMaker.

THIS IS A PRE-ALPHA SNAPSHOT RELEASE.  THE INTERFACE IS SUBJECT TO
CHANGE, AND IS LIKELY TO BE BUGGY.  USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Please type "perldoc Module::Install" after installation to see the
module usage information.

* Installation

Module::Install uses the standard perl module install process:

cpansign -v             # see SIGNATURE for details
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you have Module::Build installed, a Build.PL is also available:

cpansign -v             # see SIGNATURE for details
perl Build.PL
perl Build
perl Build test
perl Build install

* Notes for Windows users

If you are using Microsoft Windows, you will probably need the 'nmake'
utility before installation. It's available at:

    ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

If you are connected to the internet, "perl Makefile.PL" is capable
to automatically fetch it, and install into your windows directory;
all you have to do is to answer 'y' to this question:

    Required executable 'nmake' not found. Install it? [Y/n]:

However, if you are not yet online, or wish to install 'nmake' into
another directory, then please download the file manually, save it to
a directory in %PATH (e.g. C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND), then launch the MS-DOS
command line shell, "cd" to that directory, and run "nmake15.exe" from
there; that will create the 'nmake.exe' file needed by CPANPLUS.

You may then resume the installation process above, but replace 'make'
with 'nmake' in the last three lines.
