  bundled modules already exist on the system.

[Changes for 0.43 - 2005-12-12]

* Only query '$self->tests' if we haven't been given an explicit list
  (From Paul Fenwick)

* New command auto_provides() to calculate "provides:" information using
  Module::Build.  Requested by Chia-Liang Kao.

[Changes for 0.40 - 2005-12-07]

* Massively updated documentation (more to come later).

* Parentheses are now optional in Makefile.PL.

  be included in inc/.

  version indicates that it would otherwise be included. The module name has
  also been corrected so that "::" is used everywhere instead of "/".

[Changes for 0.36 - 2004-09-09]

* First version under SVK management.

* install_scripts() now takes multiple scripts to install.

[Changes for 0.35 - 2004-07-13]

  to inc::Module::Install.

* Implemented auto_include_deps() for real.

[Changes for 0.34 - 2004-07-01]

* WriteAll() now takes (inline => 1) to support
  Inline-based modules.

  (-default => 0).

* No longer use inc/SCRIPT but simply modify the scripts to install.

* Make can_cc() to probe the program part of $Config{cc}

* Bundled M::I-using modules (or subdirs) used to break up
  spectacularly by overriding ::AUTOLOAD and reusing their
  parents' inc/*.  Now the namespaces are keyed by cwd and
  more readily unregistered.

[Changes for 0.29 - 2003-12-14]

* Introducing &WriteAll, a combination of &Meta->write,
  &check_nmake, &Makefile->write, and if a Build.PL is
  present (which should read "require 'Makefile.PL'"),
  also supports transparent &Build->write.

* Real Module::Build support in WriteAll and in this module.

* Transparent Build.PL, as promised in README, is back.

* WriteAll now takes three non-metadata flags:
  check_nmake (default 1), meta (default 1) and
  sign (default 0).

* The "private" key in META.yml is officially obsoleted by "no_index".

* Now warns if the user did not specify a license.

* "requires( perl => $version )" is now supported.

* include_deps() now no longer takes its second argument;
  it must be separately supplied with the syntax above.

* "&WriteAll" now officially replaces "&Build->write",
  "&Makefile->write", "&Meta->write" and "check_nmake()".

* Implemented auto_include() and bundle_deps().

* Add "#defaults" to MANIFEST.SKIP.

  "Nmake15.exe", not "nmake15.exe".

[Changes for 0.27 - 2003-10-27]

* Make the include'd modules actually work during
  "make" and "make test", by adding "inc" to the
  Makefile targets.

* Graham's patch for 5.004 backcompat.

* Graham Barr points out that readdir() can return 0.

* Do not sign the distribution if we are not the admin.

[Changes for 0.26 - 2003-10-17]

* sign(1) support for automatic digital signing.

* no_index(directory => 'example') support, for telling
  PAUSE and search to skip indexing modules.

[Changes for 0.25 - 2003-10-13]

* Add no_index as an alias to private in META.yml.

* Support for YAML::Parser::Syck.

* No point in supporting Build.PL now.

[Changes for 0.24 - 2003-09-01]

* 0.17 is simply too old as it scans in POD sections.

* Kingpin <mthurn@carbon> notes that we are using "next"
outside a loop block in ScanDeps.

* threads.pm and warnings.pm should be exempted too.

[Changes for 0.23 - 2003-08-18]

  on the admin side.

* Andreas Koenig reports that we are writing META.yml
  even on the user side, because of this bug.

* sWitch to PAR::Dist to do make_par().

[Changes for 0.22 - 2003-07-16]

* Turns out that MakeMaker's NAME corresponds to
  META.yml's module_name, and DISTNAME corresponds
  to name.  Reflect this in the relevant files.

* Introduce a new module_name metadata key that may
  be automatically generated from name.

* /\.pm/i should be /\.pm$/i.

* Iain Truskett wants us to not overwrite alien META.yml files.

- PREREQ_PM wasn't being filled out.

- Should be including YAML dependencies too.

* POD cleanups.

[Changes for 0.21 - 2003-06-15]

* Lindsay Morris pointed out that include_deps()
  does not work with non-core modules; fixed.

[Changes for 0.20 - 2003-06-05]

* Add pointer to ingy's TPJ article.

* Eliminated warnings on 5.005.

* Added the "package inc::Module::Install;" line at
  request by Graham Barr, for search.cpan.org.

* Close META.yml before zipping; otherwise trips on win32.

* requires(), build_requires(), recommends() etc can now take
  multiple pairs in addition to a single pair.

* Add standard MANIFEST and META.yml to generated PAR file.

* Implemented the &Meta->read mentioned in the main docs.

* Our version of WriteMakefile was failing to fine Meta
  object; fixed.

* 'make reset' now just an author side alias for 'make purge'.

* The whole #! business is unneeded since MakeMaker does that.

* Don't skip other non-pm inc/ stuff when checking MANIFEST.

* The hashbang line should be the first, not last, in scripts.

* Also people may not always like -w.

* We reall want to rmtree() the distdir so that 'make manifest'
  won't include clobbered files after an aborted 'make dist'.

* Fix consistency: ->prompt() should only take one line of
  prompt and expects y/n.
